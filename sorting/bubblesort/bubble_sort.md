# bubble sort
this is a sorting algorithm  that aims to sort by letting the smaller elements bubble to the top and the bigger ones sink to the end
## bubble sort solution
### intuition
> by making sure that the element that preceeds an element is always lesser then we can iteratively achieve sorting.
## solution
- iterate over the elements
- compare the element with the one that follows it
- if our element is larger, swap them
- repeat this process atleast n-1 times to fully sort the list
